## Course Description

This course builds up on the knowledge you developed in CS220, but expands on it in a number of ways, in order to prepare you for the rest of the Computer Science curriculum. By the end of this course you will have developed a number of skills and gained a considerable amount of new knowledge, both of which will be invaluable in any future career path that involves computing.

1. You will learn the basics of a second programming language, C++, which has a number of differences compared to Python. Over your career you may have to learn a number of new programming languages, and getting used to a second language and its differences with the first one will be valuable.
2. You will gain some comfort with the Linux command line and corresponding tools. As a large majority of web and cloud services run on Linux machines and without graphical interfaces, a comfort with the command line is an essential skill to develop.
3. You will learn how programs manage their data in memory, and how to work with pointers to manually manage this memory for your program. 
4. You will learn about essential data structures like lists, stacks, queues and binary trees, how to implement them and how to consider tradeoffs of each alternative.
5.

### Resources

There are a number of online resources that you need to be familiar with:

- The [CS Discord server](https://discord.gg/f38czZQ), will be our main means of direct electronic communication. Please create a free Discord account and join the server. I recommend that you also install the app on your phone, and set it to notify you when messages are posted. I can help you set it up if you have any problems with the process.
- The [class website on HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@skiadas/B1vlWxXy_) is where notes, assignment details and links to videos will appear. This should be your primary start place for information about what you need to do before next class.
- The [course moodle page](https://moodle.hanover.edu/course/view.php?id=1064) is where homework assignments will be.
- [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) is where you will do your lab work. You will be using [GitHub codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces) coupled to individual private repositories in order to submit your project work. We will cover the details on this process during the first week.

#### Contact with Instructor

I strive to make myself as available as possible to the students. You should feel comfortable reaching out whenever you have any questions and/or need any help, and I will do my best to answer within a day (typically within a few hours, if not minutes). But please understand that I am a human being that like other human beings needs to eat, sleep, and relax, so my response time may be slower at times, especially on messages that arrive late at night or on the weekends.

There are various ways to contact me:

- The most efficient way to contact me is via a message in our class's discord channel, or a "direct message" in discord. That often gets my attention right away.
- You can email me to schedule a time or to ask a question. 
    - Asking your question over discord or email often works very well, as the effort involved in formulating your question is well worth it; you learn to communicate better, you often find the solution yourself halfway through formulating the question, and in any case there is a very good chance that I will be able to answer your question over quickly, thus saving both of us time and getting your question answered a lot faster than a meeting would have.
- You can schedule a time to meet with me either online (Zoom/Discord) or in person via my [Calendly scheduler](https://calendly.com/skiadas).

#### Textbook

Our textbook for the class covers the fundamentals of working with the C++ programming language, including discussions of various data structures and their implementation in C++. You may choose to use a physical or electronic copy, but make sure you have access to it.

### Learning Components

The course structure includes a number of components that collectively aim to solidify your understanding of the content:

1. *Reading assignments* before each class offer you a first glimpse at a topic. You essentially "read ahead", gain some initial understanding, and raise questions.
2. In-class *lectures and activities* then build on and solidify that initial understanding, clarifying and explaining things further.
3. *Practice homework assignments* in Moodle give you an opportunity to try things out and see the concepts in action.
4. *Lab assignments* are a bit more larger scale, typically asking you to think about a whole file with more than one function to implement, and think about how everything ties together. It also gives you a chance to work on the command line and using the VS Code text editor.
5. *Exams* offer checkpoints during the term to ensure that the knowledge you have acquired has stayed with you.

#### Reading records

For almost each class day there will be some reading assignment, and you are expected to submit a "reading record". These are video or audio recordings of yourself talking about the reading assignment, and each is considered completed if you have done the following:

- It is submitted by midnight the day before the class.
- It is less than 3 minutes in length.
- You mention 2-3 key things you learned in the reading.
- You ask 1-2 questions you had from the reading (you may ask more).

These reading records are aimed to ensure that you stay in touch with the material as it is covered. It is a minimal expectation for staying engaged with the course. As such, 80% completed records is a baseline requirement for any passing grade in the class.

#### Class attendance

While there is no direct line item in the grading scheme, class attendance and engagement while in class are both essential in the learning process. Please do your best to not miss any classes, but if you do have to miss a class then make sure that you learn about the material that was covered *before* the next class.

#### Homework assignments

Regular homework assignments (1-2 a week) will present you with bite-sized problems to help you reinforce and practice what you are learning. Each problem can be attempted multiple times until you have figured out how to do it. As such, they are a perfect opportunity to "try, fail, then try again". 

While homework assignments have a due date, taking the time to work on them is more important than just trying to get them out of the way in time. If you need a few more days to work on an assignment, all you have to do is ask. 

A homework assignment is considered completed when all questions on it have been answered correctly.

#### Lab assignments

Weekly lab assignments will give you an opportunity to develop your broader understanding of the concepts, but also to develop your skills as a programmer. In particular:

- You will be using an integrated development environment as well as the command line, to edit, compile and execute your program.
- You will be working with larger files with multiple functions, and multiple moving pieces, and therefore improve your ability to work with more complex pieces of code.

Timing for lab assignments:

- Lab assignments start each week during the lab sessions on Thursday. You will then be expected to spend time outside of the class, to complete them. 
- Lab assignments are due by end of day the Monday of the following week. 
- Every 3 weeks there will be a "catchup" week during which you will be able to resubmit one past lab whose grade you wish to improve
 
#### Exams

Two in-class exams will take place on Wed, Feb 14 and Wed, Mar 20, and a final exam will take place during exam week.

## Grading

The elements that enter your final grade are the following:

- Percent of reading records submitted
- Percent of homework assignments completed
- Average of lab scores
- Average of exam scores

In order to achieve a certain grade, you must reach or exceed *all* of the target values in the corresponding row in the table below:

| Grade | Reading | HW  | Labs | Exams |
|:-----:|:-------:|:---:|:----:|:-----:|
|   A   |   90%   | 90% | 90%  |  90%  |
|  A-   |   90%   | 90% | 90%  |  85%  |
|  B+   |   90%   | 80% | 80%  |  80%  |
|   B   |   90%   | 80% | 80%  |  75%  |
|  B-   |   90%   | 80% | 80%  |  70%  |
|  C+   |   80%   | 70% | 70%  |  65%  |
|   C   |   80%   | 70% | 70%  |  60%  |
|  C-   |   80%   | 70% | 70%  |  55%  |
|  D+   |   80%   | 70% | 60%  |  50%  |
|   D   |   80%   | 70% | 60%  |  45%  |


## Student Success Resources

College life and coursework is challenging, especially in times like these. The college has set up a large ecosystem of support, from IT staff, Librarians and Learning Center tutors to Accessibility Services, Counceling Services and our Chaplain. All of these folks are here to support you and your needs, please do not hesitate to reach out to them whenever you need assistance. There are links to all these services at the top of our Moodle page.

Also please make sure to read the "Hanover College Policies" document linked there, and also [here](https://it.hanover.edu/syllabuspolicies.pdf).

### CS Lab tutors

CS lab tutors are also available to support you in your learning process. Here is a link to the [tutor schedule](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hbr7-9dw7i2uhYhaFU1siD3Nv_RTVZfXZfvQubCQC9Q/edit?usp=sharing).

Please keep in mind that the tutors have limited time, possibly many students to help, and are there to support you and not just give you the answers to your questions. Don't expect that you can show up to their sessions on the day a lab is due and with little prepared, and expect that your lab will be magically completed after meeting them. Plan ahead, allocate sufficient time to your labs, bring concrete questions to the tutors.
